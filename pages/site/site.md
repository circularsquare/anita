its pretty cool, right? 

jan 2023 i started thinking a lot about making a website to document all of myself. if i write down everything, i will exist for as long as the writing exists. 

feb 2023 is when i started setting up the html. i just switched over to jekyll and it's really nice! it's very well documented and easy to use.

now the website exists, and i'm typing things. who knows what will happen next?
