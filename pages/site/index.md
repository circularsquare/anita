its pretty cool, right? 

202301 i started thinking a lot about making a website to document all of myself. all my likes, dislikes, experiences, friends. all of my past, present, and future. if i write down everything, i will exist for as long as the writing exists. 202302 is when i started setting up the html. i just switched over to jekyll and it's really nice! very well documented and easy to use.

now the website exists, and i'm typing things. who knows what will happen next?
