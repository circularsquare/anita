will i run out of time? i am constantly concerned with running out of time.

i am concerned that my mind is melting, like a red root floater that has been pushed or pulled underwater. melt to my network of veins, and then to nothing. and that each day, if i don't will myself to stay at the surface, i will melt a little bit more. 

i have never been buoyant. i can tread water, but only for twenty seconds or so, and then i start to sink. i have friends who are uplifting, and i can help myself by holding onto them, but then i'm pulling them down with me.

do i need to be on the surface? this is a fair question. i have spent fifteen or so years existing already. and maybe my subconscious has already cast its vote. why do i keep bunnies and plants? these are weights. i keep them in order to sink. shouldn't i have stopped treading a while ago? shouln't i let my mind melt?

(i think this is normal. i think this is how a lot of people's relationships with time are. )



i've already run out of time

i'm already stagnant

a deep option
