i am currently a trader.

in college i studied physics, math, and cs, and graduated in 2022.

in 2021, i did my senior thesis on recoil in viscoelastic materials. when you stretch out a viscoelastic material and let go, how does the impulse travel down the material? how do the material properties determine the amount of energy and power you can get out of the recoil? how have animals evolved to optimize these parameters? these sorts of questions.

in 2020, i did a project where we found systematic defects in silicon wafers. we used fourier transforms to find repeated defects and clutering algorithms to find smudges and blobs, and some other techniques for other stuff.

my interests include data analysis and visual art and plants.

i'm currently working on a base-building game called shonei. the inhabitants of the player-settlements will be mice with a capitalist tendency. my goal is to create an interesting economy where players specialize into various production chains and send exports to a centralized market. i'm using unity. this serves as a place where i can learn how to make games.

in the future, i want to work on a game called celia where you play as a mushroom who awakens under a tree. directly near the roots of the tree is safe, but farther out, toxin limits where you can go, which is produced by an aerial bacteria of unknown origin. by meeting and befriending other fungus species, you will be able to merge your mycorhizal networks, and your minds/souls. species will grant the ability to construct different specialized structures, allowing more complex actions such as humidification or nitrogen fixation, which will expand your reach. your eventual goal is to bring the bacteria population under control and remove most of the toxin, which will allow biodiversity to return.
