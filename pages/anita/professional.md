i am currently a trader at five rings. i started in 2022. 'salright.

i went to college at harvey mudd and studied physics, math, and cs. 

in 2021, i did my senior thesis with mark ilton on recoil in viscoelastic materials. when you stretch out a viscoelastic material and let go, how does the impulse travel down the material? how do the material properties determine the amoutn of energy and power you can get out of the recoil? how have animals evolved to optimize these parameters? these sorts of questions.

in 2020, i did a clinic project for galaxy semiconductor where we found systematic defects in silicon wafers. we used fourier transforms to find repeated defects and clutering algorithms to find smudges and blobs, and some other techniques for other stuff.

my interests include data analysis and visual art and plants.
it would be cool to bring these together. maybe with some sort of... plant inspired data visualization?
