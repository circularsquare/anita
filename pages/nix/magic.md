it's known that there are three forms of mana: water, nix, and air. water is the mana of flowing, and is the only one that can be directly controlled by people. nix is the mana of gravity. air is the mana of energy. in practice, these three mana and their interactions are taken as physical axioms. efforts to break them down further have not been successful. 

the following information has not been discovered by anyone in nix yet, but it is how the world works.

#### mana

water mana is just a fundamental particle which i call a suiton. it has mass similar to a neutrino. it is mostly governed by a fifth fundamental force (in addition to gravity, electriomagnetism, etc.), called suiton force. there are two types of suitons: up and down suitons. they have no electric charge, but do have suiton charge (+1 and -1). they cannot be created or destroyed. the suiton attractive force follows an inverse square law. suitons are fermions so they experience pauli repulsion. they generally form clusters. 

quarks and leptons also have a suiton charge equal to their electromagnetic charge. most of chemistry arises from the fact that only so many electrons are allowed to fit into each shell, and the shells come from spherical symmetry and the inverse square law of the electrostatic force. suiton force and electromagnetism are sort of the same in these respects. so a configuration of a nix atom must satisfy both the normal electromagnetic rules as well as the parallel suiton rules. in the absence of suitons, this is satisfied since electrons and protons and neutrons have proportional charges in both forces. but if there is a down suiton present, it actually has the potential to take the place of an electron. ???

it also has a weaker attraction to certain forms of matter, which lets it be pushed around. 

nix mana is a localized area of hyperbolic space. this means that things travelling through areas dense in nix mana will take longer to travel. in practice this is hard to observe since the scale at which space folds is much smaller than atoms. but if you try to move your hand through nix mana it will feel more resistance than usual. nix mana also has weird lensing effects on light, you can effectively get it to have arbitrarily high refractive index, and you can sort of make fiber optics cables this way. it cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be pushed around by suitons. on earth, only gravity shapes spacetime, but on nix, suiton force also shapes it. i'm not sure if that really makes sense but yeah.

air mana is a composite particle of two suitons.
