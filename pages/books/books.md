- dream of polar fog - 8/10
    - a tribe in chukotka and a canadian man who joins them. very beautiful. feels authentic and true to that land, though i wouldn't know.
- the power broker - 6/10
    - very informative. i loved listening to it while walking around new york city, seeing the places that these politicians fought over.
- paradise - 8/10
    - when i read this, i had the thought that i would not have understood this book as andrew. 
- organ meats - 5/10
    - a wonderful surreal mess of words. i unfortunately identify with anita (the character in the book)
- inverted world - 8/10
    - its pacing is incredible, and its world is so original and deeply disturbing.
- three body problem - 10/10
    - the part in the 3rd book about the future society where there's only women really stuck with me. the portrayal of the consequences is super sexist but i can't help but like it
