its pretty cool, right? 

jan 2023 i started thinking a lot about making a website to document all of myself. if i write down everything, i will exist for as long as the writing exists. 

feb 2023 is when i started setting up the html. i just switched over to jekyll and it's really nice! it's very well documented and easy to use.

installation is super annoying though. getting ruby to work on windows / wsl is a big hassle, because the maintenance isn't great.
