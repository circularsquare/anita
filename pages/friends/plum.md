is a type of tree, closely related to peaches and cherries. in the spring they fill up with bright pink papery petals.

he's sweet... and a bit aloof at times.

when i'm with you, it feels ok to leave the world.

plum is very easygoing and makes friends easily. he works as an event organizer. he also likes putting me into boxes, like [sundew](/friends/sundew). when i speak with him, it feels so natural that it almost feels like we're just thinking in each others heads. this is in contrast to when i speak with strangers which feels precarious. plum is a conversational wizard. he also is good at computers.
