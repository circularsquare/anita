plum is a genus of trees and bushes in rosaceae, closely related to other common stonefruits, and almonds. in the spring they fill up with bright pink papery petals.

plum reminds me of my dad. he builds extremely methodically, always being through a microscope. which is interesting because he's the opposite way with social interaction. 

when i'm with you, it feels ok to leave the world.
