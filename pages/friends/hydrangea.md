hydrangea is a family of flowering plants that are usually bushes. their flowers are pink in basic soil and blue in acidic soil. which is weird because it's usually the other way i thought.

hydrangea is a resolute mother. willing to fight people for no reason. 

when i was young, all i wanted was to be more like you. strong and pretty. when you showered me with flowers, i was happier than i've ever been.

you made me, in several ways.
