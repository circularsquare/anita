is a plant that grows in streams, and grows very quickly. it's related to radish and wasabi. the leaves are fresh and a bit peppery!

she's a writer at heart. she loves music and has wide eyes. 

what did you see in me? a man? 

we did volunteer events together. we discovered the city together. we grew up together. such good times!

now, she's studying to be a doctor near the [meadow](/places/meadow).
