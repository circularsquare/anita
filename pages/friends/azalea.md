shimmering burning cellophane pink, 

in his light i am able to remember that i am real. it makes the world larger and more real. a type of color not representable on computer screens

his voice pierces the clouds in heat and clarity

there was a time when i got impatient, when he was following me. one of my bigger regrets. i am so grateful that he lets me follow him back today.
