poinsettia is a type of euphorbia indigenous to [shilla](/places/shilla). it has clusters of bright red leaves among the green. the first time i saw you, i thought the red leaves were a flock of birds. 

she makes cakes in a cute store in a town in the south of shilla, in the foothills of trapzon.

poinsettia is chaos and love

a navigator of humans

standing on a summit

where will you go?

will it be into the body of a new victim or your own

i watch in anticipation
