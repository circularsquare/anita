russula is a genus of mostly red mushrooms with brittle gills. they form ectomycorrhiza with plants. they are common in lakta.

russula is currently a mathematician in one of the near valleys of lisand. russula is a spear.

you see mushrooms so easily. is doing math like walking in a forest for you? do the lines of derivation look like tree trunks? are the paths ahead lit by little red clusters of caps?

we've had so many interesting conversations. i miss you
