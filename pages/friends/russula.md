is a type of colorful mushroom with delicate gills. many russulas have red caps and most are edible. they are common in lakta.

you see mushrooms so easily. is doing math like walking in a forest for you? do the lines of derivation look like tree trunks? are the paths ahead lit by little red clusters of caps?

we've had so many interesting conversations. i miss you
