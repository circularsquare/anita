is cool. they like tea and has a soft voice and a soft face. 

sometimes we walk in the morning to the cavern. how did we end up here?

they exist in the world. they talk about distant events and people. when they take my mind to these places i feel as if i'm in the world too, which is a nice feeling to have.
