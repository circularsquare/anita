it's a wide one.

every morning, groups of old chinese people do taichi. i wonder if some day i'll be there with them?

the bridges rise into the sky. they look a little steampunklike, with wires dangling hundreds of feet from the beige criss crossing beams. they rumble like huge animals.

the water washes away

all the dirt

all the people

all of my thoughts

### the river cottage

as of june 2023 i live here now. it's a very nice open place with windows on both sides so that the air rushes through, onshore and offshore. it's quite shaded.

it's big enough to have people over. plum is over a lot. they make it feel less empty, which is nice.
