poinsettia lives here. it's quite far from my home.

it's warm, but everyone is used to the warmth, so they wear quite heavy clothing anyways. it's a very relaxing place. there's plenty of fruits and sweet breads and easy-going people.

what does it mean that i miss shilla so much? i used to only like cold places, right? what changed? the same thing that made it so that i now need the lights to be on, unless i'm on acid.

i want to go back and stay with you for a time
