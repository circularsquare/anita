a jungle peninsula in west rayna. mostly inhabited by snakes and frogs of all shapes and sizes. there is also a human population on the west coast, in the shadow of the piqua mountains, where it is rainy and relatively cold. there are also some cats in the hills to the south. there are many animals and medicinal plants and spices only found here. magic is used fairly widely due to proximity to trapzon. it's not too friendly to outsiders.

[poinsettia](/friends/poinsettia) grows here. it's quite far from my home.

it's warm, but everyone is used to the warmth, so they wear quite heavy clothing anyways. it's a very relaxing place. there's plenty of fruits and sweet breads and easy-going people.

what does it mean that i miss shilla so much? i used to only like cold places, right? what changed? the same thing that made it so that i now need the lights to be on, unless i'm on acid.

i want to go back and stay with you for a time
