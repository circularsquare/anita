shonei is one of the two mouse kingdoms, along with [fulan](/places/fulan). it is a vast grassland region in the interior of rayna, roughly corresponding to the shonei river watershed. it has a fairly warm climate, suitable for two or even three annual wheat crops in certain regions. 

the mice that inhabit the region are skillful engineers, with towering cities of steel and timber, though they rarely welcome visitors. politically, shonei is fairly isolationist, though they do conduct trade through their port city of bakou. they are staunch capitalists. each day dozens of barges float up and down the shonei river, bound for some enterprise.
