the cavern is an endless network. parts of it are made of crystals that dwarf the biggest animals. these large crystals can sometimes look like oceans. 

many people try to mine here for gemstones, and they often find what they're looking for. there are so many crevices that it's not too hard to end up somewhere no one has been before. the main risk is getting lost. there are not so many exits.
